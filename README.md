# Coffee Machine

A simple coffee machine program written in Python. This program simulates a coffee machine where users can select different types of coffee, insert coins, and receive their drink if the transaction is successful. The program also keeps track of resources and can generate a report on the current status of the machine.

## Features

- **Coffee Selection**: Users can choose between espresso, latte, and cappuccino.
- **Coin Processing**: The machine accepts quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
- **Resource Management**: The machine tracks the available resources (water, milk, coffee) and updates them after each transaction.
- **Transaction Handling**: The machine checks if the user has inserted enough money and provides change if necessary.
- **Reporting**: Users can request a report of the current resources and money in the machine.
- **Power Off**: Users can turn off the machine.
